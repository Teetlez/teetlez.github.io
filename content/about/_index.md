## About Me

### Contact Information

### Background

I grew up in a multicultural household, a South African mother and an American father. This experience has given me a unique perspective and appreciation for different cultures and ways of life. After graduating from high school, I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology and decided to attend the University of New Hampshire to study Computer Science. During my studies, I discovered a passion for programming and the thrill of solving complex problems. I am a detail-oriented individual, taking pride in my work and constantly looking to improve my skills and knowledge.

### Interests

Ever since I discovered the world of programming, I have been captivated by the ability to create systems that adapt to changes and tell complex stories from simple inputs. This fascination led me to the study of computer graphics, where I became enamored with the techniques used to create stunning visuals. Before I had access to a computer with a decent video card, I spent countless hours watching YouTube videos of games and 3D-rendered animations, studying and admiring the graphical techniques used, such as:

- Shadow maps
- Bump mapping
- Parallax textures
- Global illumination
- Ambient occlusion
- Volumetric lighting

The allure of creating art through logic was inescapable, and I have been in love with it ever since. This passion has only grown stronger over the years, and I continue to explore new techniques and algorithms to grow my knowledge.

In my free time, I enjoy:

- Snowboarding
- Philosophy
- 3D-printing
- Video games
- Airsoft
- Chess
- Piano
