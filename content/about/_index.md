# Timothy Clocksin

**Engineer & Builder of Tools**

I enjoy crafting performant systems, building visual experiences, and making things that feel both elegant and efficient. I’ve worked on everything from network tools to VR experiences, often blending practical utility with a visual or conceptual edge.

<br>

## What I Do

- Architect and optimize tools for system diagnostics, data workflows, and automation.
- Design 3D environments and rendering engines for experimental and applied projects.
- Build and refine pipelines—whether DevOps, visual, or computational—for speed and clarity.
- Explore the intersection of logic, visual aesthetics, and human-centered tooling.

## Selected Projects

[**Albacore VR**](/projects/albacore-vr/)
Interactive museum experience for Oculus Quest

- Designed accessible 3D spaces in Unity and Blender
- Optimized complex models for real-time rendering
- Honored at a university research conference for innovation in accessibility

[**Rust Path-Tracer**](/projects/rust-pathtracer/)  
A minimal, physically-based renderer built from scratch

- Implemented BVH acceleration, global illumination, and custom material models
- Created as a deep-dive into Rust, rendering math, and code aesthetics

## Technical Interests

I lean toward tools and languages that prioritize expressiveness, performance, and clarity. A few that I’ve spent meaningful time with:

**Languages:**  
Rust • C++ • Python • Tcl • JavaScript • Bash

**Tools & Frameworks:**  
Git • Docker • Linux • OpenGL • Unity • Blender • Django

## Elsewhere

I'm based in New England, and when I’m not working on technical projects, I like exploring visual logic, teaching, or experimenting with generative systems.
