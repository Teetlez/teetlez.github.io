Hi, I’m **Timothy**. I’m a **Computer Science graduate** with a deep passion
for technology and its ability to solve complex problems. What I enjoy most
is the creation of beauty through rules and logic similar to how nature gives
such intracate, complex, and elegant wonders from the rules given to her.
This love eventually led me to the field of computer graphics, where I am
able to solve logical problems and get an artistic outcome.
