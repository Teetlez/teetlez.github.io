# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Timothy**. I’m a **Computer Science graduate** with a deep passion for technology and its ability to solve complex problems. What I enjoy most is the creation of beauty through rules and logic similar to how nature gives such intracate, complex, and elegant wonders from the rules given to her. This love eventually led me to the field of computer graphics, where I am able to solve logical problems and get an artistic outcome.

## A space for logical art

This website is a place for me to showcase my projects, share my thoughts through essays, and give you a glimpse into what drives me. Whether you’re here to check out my latest work, learn more about my journey, or just see what I’m passionate about, I’m excited to share it with you.

I created this site to connect with others, to offer a space where my work and ideas can be explored, and to hopefully spark some interesting ideas for others. I’m always open to new collaborations, whether it's for a project, a discussion, or just sharing knowledge!

## A Little More About Me

When I’m not working on technology, you can find me indulging in a few hobbies that keep my life balanced:

- **Snowboarding** – I love the rush of the slopes and the peacefulness of being in nature.
- **Philosophy** – I enjoy thinking deeply about the world around me and the big questions in life.
- **3D-printing** – There’s something incredibly satisfying about turning digital designs into physical objects.
- **Video games** – I’ve always been fascinated by the immersive worlds they create.
- **Airsoft** – It's all about strategy, teamwork, and a little bit of adrenaline.
- **Chess** – A game that teaches patience, strategy, and the beauty of logic.
- **Piano** – Playing music helps me unwind and think creatively.

## Let's Connect

If you’re interested in collaborating, discussing ideas, or just want to connect, feel free to reach out! I’m always open to new opportunities, whether they’re technical, creative, or both.

Thank you for taking the time to visit my site. I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity, and I’d love to hear from you soon!

Cheers,
**Timothy C**
