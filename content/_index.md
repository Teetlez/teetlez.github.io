Hi, I‚Äôm **Timothy**. I‚Äôm a **Computer Science graduate** with a deep passion
for technology and its ability to solve complex problems. What I enjoy most
is the creation of beauty through rules and logic similar to how nature gives
such intracate, complex, and elegant wonders from the rules given to her.
This love eventually led me to the field of computer graphics, where I am
able to solve logical problems and get an artistic outcome.

## A space for logical art

This website is a place for me to showcase my projects, share my thoughts through essays, and give you a glimpse into what drives me. Whether you‚Äôre here to check out my latest work, learn more about my journey, or just see what I‚Äôm passionate about, I‚Äôm excited to share it with you.

I created this site to connect with others, to offer a space where my work and ideas can be explored, and to hopefully spark some interesting ideas for others. I‚Äôm always open to new collaborations, whether it's for a project, a discussion, or just sharing knowledge!

### Why the name?

The name `LOG√ÜŒ£THOS` (Lo-ges-thos) comes from a combination of the Greek words `LOGOS` and `AESTHETIKOS` using some Greek letters (**√Ü** and **Œ£**). Basically a marriage between logic and aesthetics

> I'm probably going to really regret throwing non-ascii text in for something like my website title with regards to browser rendering/compatability, but that's an issue for future Tim :smile:

I know that technically it would be something like `ŒõŒüŒìŒïŒ£ŒòŒüŒ£` or `LOGEŒ£ŒòŒüŒ£` using the koine greek epsilon **E** and possibly theta **Œò**, but I think that it's a happy medium between phonetic readability and etomology. Plus I think it looks cool, and in the end, language was made for man, not man for language.

I also decided on the sylalized logo version **`Œõ√ÜŒ£`** by taking the beginning, middle, and end of the word as greek letters. Simply because I think the way **√Ü** creates a cool transition between **Œõ** and **Œ£**
