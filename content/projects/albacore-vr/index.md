The Albacore Submarine is a decommissioned military vessel that served from 1953 to 1972 and has since been converted into a museum exhibit. This project aims to create a **virtual reality tour** of the submarine using an **Oculus Quest 2 VR headset**, providing an accessible experience for those unable to visit the submarine in person.

## Overview

To recreate the submarine's environment:

- **Unity** was used to simulate the submarine's appearance and functionality in a virtual space.
- **Blender** was employed to design 3D assets, including gauges, buoys, and the submarine's exterior.
- Motion control capabilities and interactive objects (e.g., switches and controls) were incorporated for an immersive experience.

This VR tour will be available at designated stations at the museum, making the submarine accessible to all.
