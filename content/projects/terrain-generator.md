This project showcases a **non-interactive terrain generator** capable of creating natural-looking environments, including **trees**, **grass**, **mountains**, **snow**, **beaches**, **lakes/ponds**, **clouds**, and **hills**. The generator leverages **Perlin noise** for smooth, realistic transitions and an **isometric viewpoint** for a stylized aesthetic.

## Overview

### Key Features

- **Perlin Noise**: Generates natural-looking terrain shapes and textures.
- **Isometric Viewpoint**: Provides a clean and stylized perspective.
- **Procedural Generation**: Every render is unique.
